This repo contains an monte carlo simulation that was part of a capstone project I worked on for a monte carlo methods class in grad school. The data, presentation, and R Markdown output document with embedded code is included

All of the html and markdown documents or files rendered here were created using RMarkdown (https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html). 

I am using github documents output format in a README.Rmd to create this README.md file GitHub renders as a sort of de-facto landing page for this repo. 

This repo had renv (https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) initialized for reproducibility; keep in mind there are system dependencies (e.g. Rtools, etc.) on top of package dependencies

Below is a table with some links for easy navigation of this repo

```{r table-links, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE }

library(gt)
library(tidyverse)

df <- tibble(
  Topic = c("Presentation slides"
            ,"Presentation RMarkdown"
            ,"README RMarkdown"),
  url = c("https://github.com/hcastel1/RealRisk-PowerPlantNPV/blob/master/Presentation/presentation.md",
          "https://github.com/hcastel1/RealRisk-PowerPlantNPV/blob/master/Presentation/presentation.Rmd",
          "https://github.com/hcastel1/RealRisk-PowerPlantNPV/blob/master/README.Rmd"))
  

df2 = df %>%
    mutate(
        url = glue::glue("[link]({url})"),
        url = map(url, gt::md))

knitr::kable(df2)
