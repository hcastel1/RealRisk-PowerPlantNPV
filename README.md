Introduction
================

This repo contains an monte carlo simulation that was part of a capstone
project I worked on for a monte carlo methods class in grad school. The
data, presentation, and R Markdown output document with embedded code is
included

All of the html and markdown documents or files rendered here were
created using RMarkdown (<https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html>).

I am using github documents output format in a README.Rmd to create this
README.md file GitHub renders as a sort of de-facto landing page for
this repo.

This repo had renv (<https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html>)
initialized for reproducibility; keep in mind there are system
dependencies (e.g.Â Rtools, etc.) on top of package dependencies

Below is a table with some links for easy navigation of this repo
